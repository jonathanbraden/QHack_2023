# QHack_2023
My solutions to QHack 2023 coding problems.

Managed to finish all of the problems while working sporadically in between work and family commitments.
Ended up as the 28th place team, which I'm pretty happy with given the limited time I had to work on the problems.

Was fun experience and a good chance to get my feet wet with Pennylane and learn a bit about quantum computing.
